# Coding Challenges

The following are the coding challenges I solved which are provided by 
different coding websites and AI.

1. **Missing Number**
   Problem: Find the Missing Number
   You are given an array of integers from 1 to N, where one of the numbers is missing. Your task is to write a function that finds and returns the missing number.
   For example:
   If the given array is `[3, 7, 1, 2, 8, 4, 5]`, the missing number is 6.
   If the given array is `[10, 5, 1, 4, 3, 6, 8, 7, 9]`, the missing number is 2.
   Write a function in your preferred programming language to solve this problem efficiently. Feel free to implement any algorithm or approach you think is suitable.
