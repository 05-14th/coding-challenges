# Coding Challenges

The following are the coding challenges I solved which are provided by 
different coding websites and AI.

1. **Missing Number**

   Problem: Find the Missing Number
   
   You are given an array of integers from 1 to N, where one of the numbers is missing. Your task is to write a function that finds and returns the missing number.
   For example:
   
   If the given array is `[3, 7, 1, 2, 8, 4, 5]`, the missing number is 6.
   
   If the given array is `[10, 5, 1, 4, 3, 6, 8, 7, 9]`, the missing number is 2.
   
   Write a function in your preferred programming language to solve this problem efficiently. Feel free to implement any algorithm or approach you think is suitable.


2. **Create Phone Number**

   Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

   For example:
   `createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0])` // => returns "(123) 456-7890"
